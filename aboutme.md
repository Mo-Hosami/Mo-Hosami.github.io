### My story

My name is Mohammad Hosami. In 2017, I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics, Numerical Analysis from University of Guilan, Iran. For nearly a decade, from 2013 to 2022, I worked as a lecturer in Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Guilan and Fouman Faculty of Engineering- University of Tehran. From 2022 to 2024, I created four online courses on FaraDars, the largest online course platform in Iran, titled "Numerical Analysis- Part 1", "Numerical Analysis- Part 2", "Autograph 5 to visualize mathematics in 2D and 3D" and "Plotting with Maple". Also, I work as an online tutor for mathematics and programming.
Throughout my teaching experience, I have instructed a wide range of courses, including calculus, ODEs, numerical computations, computer programming (C++, Matlab, and Maple), algorithm design, and data structures. This experience, along with my passion for teaching and research, has led me to explore the exciting field of computer science and multidisciplinary research. Additionally, I have a strong interest in literature and philosophy.
