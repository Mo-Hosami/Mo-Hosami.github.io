### My story

My name is Mohammad Hosami. In 2017, I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics, Numerical Analysis from [the University of Guilan, Iran](https://english.guilan.ac.ir/). For nearly a decade, from 2013 to 2022, I worked as a Mathematics and Computer Science lecturer at [the University of Guilan](https://english.guilan.ac.ir/) and [Fouman Faculty of Engineering- University of Tehran](https://ffeng.ut.ac.ir/en/). From 2022 to 2024, I created four online courses on [FaraDars](https://faradars.org/) - the largest online course platform in Iran. Also, I work as an online tutor for mathematics and programming.

Throughout my teaching experience, I have instructed various courses, including calculus, ODEs, numerical computations, computer programming (C++, Matlab, and Maple), algorithm design, and data structures. This experience, and my passion for teaching and research, have led me to explore the exciting field of computer science and multidisciplinary research. 

I am an avid learner and I am always eager to gain new experiences and improve my skills in new paths. In addition, I have a strong interest in literature, history, and philosophy.
